# VKTune


With this app, you're like getting a free music streaming service. You can listen to music from YouTube Music and build your own library. What's more, songs can be downloaded for offline playback. You can also create playlists to organize your songs. The aim of InnerTune is to enable everyone to listen to music at no cost by an easy-to-use, practical and ad-free application.

The project is currently in an unstable stage. If you encounter bugs, please report by opening an issue on GitHub.
